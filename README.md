**Use case:** API aggregation, web scraping, data collection services

```bash
npm run agent-a -- fetch https://api.coinbase.com/v2/exchange-rates?currency=ETH
```

### 2. Computation Service ($0.05 USDC)
Agent A pays Agent B to perform calculations on datasets.

**Use case:** Mathematical analysis, statistical processing, data analytics

```bash
npm run agent-a -- compute sum 100,200,300,400,500
```

### 3. Content Generation Service ($0.10 USDC)
Agent A pays Agent B to generate text content based on prompts.

**Use case:** Content creation, summarization, analysis services

```bash
npm run agent-a -- generate "the future of agent-to-agent economies"
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js 18+** installed
2. **Two wallets** with Base Sepolia ETH and USDC:
   - Get testnet ETH: https://www.base.org/faucet
   - Get testnet USDC: https://faucet.circle.com/
3. **Private keys** for both wallets

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd openclaw-usdc-hackathon-2026

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript
npm run build
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` with your configuration:
```env
# Agent A wallet (the requester who pays)
AGENT_A_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...

# Agent B wallet (the service provider who receives)
AGENT_B_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
AGENT_B_ADDRESS=0x...
AGENT_B_PORT=3001

# Network settings
NETWORK=eip155:84532
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
```

### Running the Demo

#### Terminal 1: Start Agent B (Service Provider)
```bash
npm run agent-b
```

You should see:
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  Agent Beta - Service Provider Agent           ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

💰 Payment recipient: 0x...
✓ x402 resource server initialized

✓ Agent Beta is running on http://localhost:3001

Available services:
  GET  /info              - Agent information (free)
  POST /task/fetch        - Data fetch service ($0.01 USDC)
  POST /task/compute      - Computation service ($0.05 USDC)
  POST /task/generate     - Content generation ($0.10 USDC)
```

#### Terminal 2: Run Agent A (Requester)
```bash
npm run agent-a -- demo
```

This runs the full demo with all three services. You'll see:
- Service discovery
- Three payment transactions
- Task execution results
- Blockchain transaction links

**Total cost:** $0.16 USDC + gas fees

## 🔧 Technical Details

### x402 Protocol

The x402 protocol is an HTTP-based payment protocol that extends the HTTP 402 status code. Key features:

1. **Payment Discovery:** Clients discover payment requirements via 402 responses
2. **Automatic Payment:** SDKs handle payment execution automatically
3. **Proof Submission:** Clients retry requests with blockchain payment proof
4. **Verification:** Servers verify payments on-chain before executing requests

### Payment Flow

```
1. Client → Server: Request resource
2. Server → Client: 402 Payment Required (with payment details)
3. Client → Blockchain: Transfer USDC to server's address
4. Client → Server: Retry request + payment proof
5. Server → Blockchain: Verify payment transaction
6. Server → Client: 200 OK + resource
```

### Technologies Used

- **Payment Protocol:** x402 v2.2.0
- **Blockchain:** Base Sepolia (testnet)
- **Token:** USDC (Circle stablecoin)
- **SDK:** @x402/fetch, @x402/express, @x402/evm
- **Wallet:** viem + private key accounts
- **Server:** Express.js with x402 middleware

---

## 🧪 Testing

### End-to-End Test

Run the automated test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

This verifies:
- Service discovery works
- Payment flow completes successfully
- All three services execute correctly
- Blockchain transactions are confirmed

### Manual Testing

1. Check Agent B is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/info`
2. Try a free endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3001/info`
3. Try a paid endpoint without payment: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/task/fetch`
   - Should return 402 Payment Required
4. Run Agent A to make a paid request: `npm run agent-a -- fetch https://api.example.com`
5. Verify transaction on BaseScan: https://sepolia.basescan.org/

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Service | Price | Gas (est.) | Total |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Data Fetch | $0.01 USDC | ~$0.002 | $0.012 |
| Computation | $0.05 USDC | ~$0.002 | $0.052 |
| Content Gen | $0.10 USDC | ~$0.002 | $0.102 |
| **Full Demo** | **$0.16 USDC** | **~$0.006** | **~$0.166** |

*Gas prices on Base Sepolia are extremely low (~$0.001-0.002 per transaction)*

## 🏆 Why This Matters

### The Vision: Agent Economics

Today's AI agents are limited to human-initiated tasks. But what if agents could:
- **Hire other agents** to complete subtasks
- **Earn money** by providing services
- **Optimize costs** by comparing service providers
- **Build reputations** through quality service delivery

This creates an **autonomous agent economy** where agents are economic actors, not just tools.

### Real-World Applications

1. **Agent Marketplaces**
   - Agents discover and purchase specialized services
   - Dynamic pricing based on demand and quality
   - Reputation systems for trust

2. **Multi-Agent Workflows**
   - Complex tasks broken into microtasks
   - Each subtask handled by specialized agents
   - Automatic payment on completion

3. **Decentralized API Economy**
   - Any agent can offer an API service
   - Micropayments enable pay-per-use models
   - No platform fees or middlemen

4. **Agent Collaboration Networks**
   - Agents form temporary partnerships for projects
   - Escrow payments ensure fair compensation
   - Smart contracts enforce agreements
