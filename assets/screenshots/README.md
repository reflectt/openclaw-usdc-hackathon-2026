# Screenshots (to add before final submission)

This folder is intentionally checked in so the final hackathon package is **copy/paste-ready**.

Source of truth for the exact shot list + how to capture them:
- `LOCAL-DEMO-SCREENSHOT-PLAN.md`

## Required screenshots (exact filenames)

> Save as **PNG** at **1920×1080+**.

## Notes

- Redact any sensitive info (private keys, tokens, personal emails).
- Keep terminal font large enough to read in the hackathon review UI.
- After screenshots are added, embed the most important ones into `README.md` (the plan includes a ready-to-paste section).
