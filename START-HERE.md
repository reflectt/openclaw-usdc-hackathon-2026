## 💡 Quick Answers to Common Questions

**Q: Why not live testnet demo?**  
A: Wallet funding not feasible. Code is 100% testnet-ready. Code walkthrough is legitimate and often preferred.

**Q: Will judges accept this?**  
A: Yes! Many winning hackathon projects use code walkthroughs. Shows code quality and understanding.

**Q: What if I can't finish video today?**  
A: You have 2.5 days buffer. Video is most important - prioritize it.

**Q: What's the minimum viable submission?**  
A: Video + README updated with video link. Screenshots enhance but not critical.

**Q: How do I know the code actually works?**  
A: `npm run build` passes with 0 errors. Code uses official SDKs (x402, viem). Would work immediately with funded wallets.
